Some tips I want to keep somewhere


How to update a forked repo inside github.com website:
------------------------------------------------------

* From your forked repo, click on "pull request" and button "new pull request"

* Click on the "edit" button at the right of the line where you have names of the original repo and your repo.
* It will appear some buttons, one with a "base fork" and the other with "head fork".
* Change "base fork", with your fork. page will refresh and said anything to compare (Hey, you try to compare your own repo with itself !).
* Re-click on the "edit" button, and click on the link who appears: "compare across forks"
* The base/head fork buttons will re-appears, then change the Head fork with the original fork.
* 
If   all is up to date, no new commit 
Else you will see the list of commits from the original repo.
* Validate the pull request to send it in your list inside your repo.  
* Next, you can do like any other pull request.
Github will see if you can merge directly the pull request with your repo.
